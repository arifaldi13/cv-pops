# The Present-Day CV Population

CV population material in Putra 24 (in preparation)

## The Database

The database is in the folder 'MESA_COMPILED' which consists of a compiled MESA output with $M_1$, $M_2$, and $P_\text{i}$ as the initial parameters and $P_\text{f}$, $P_\text{WD}$ and the status of mass transfer that in the threshold of CV at the time of given age. Each txt file represents the "age window". The list of corresponding ages is in the _legend.txt file. The value of simulation results consists of an inf value, which means the model already 'dead' at the age window.

## Present-Day CV Data

The data is in the folder "POPS" which consists of the synthesized present-day CV population. This is the result of interpolation of the database with the grid. It has the initial parameters and values ($M_1$, $M_2$, and $P_\text{i}$) and the corresponding interpolated values $P_\text{f}$ and $P_\text{WD}$. Each txt file represents the "age window". The list of corresponding ages is in the _legend.txt file.
